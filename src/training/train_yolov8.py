This script used to provide a CLI entrypoint for training YOLOv8.

It has been removed/disabled in the repository. Please use the
Jupyter notebook `notebooks/02_train_yolov8.ipynb` to run YOLOv8 training
or invoke training via a dedicated CI/Make task if needed.

If you intentionally want to restore a CLI trainer, consider moving
the implementation into `src/scripts/` or re-adding this file with the
desired behavior.

Exiting to avoid accidental runs.
